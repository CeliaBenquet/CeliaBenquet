I'm a second-year PhD candidate at the [Mathis Lab of Adaptative Intelligence](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/) 🐭. 

🔭 I'm currently working on understanding how the brain represents external features in its environment and constructs internal models to generalize and extract the relevant information from it 🧩. I have a strong interest in investigating the dynamics 💫 taking place during the formation of such neural representations while learning a task. To do so, I relate motor control 💪 and vision 👀 by exploring the processes at play in active sensing.

- 👩‍🎓 EPFL alumna 🇨🇭, specialization in computational neurosciences 🧠
- Master's thesis at the Uchida Lab (Harvard University), on the neural basis of belief state computation in the brain.
